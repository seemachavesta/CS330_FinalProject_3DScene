# CS330 Final Project - 3D Scene and Design Decisions

This repository contains my final project for CS-330: Computational Graphics and Visualization. It includes the 3D Scene ZIP folder, the Design Decisions document, and this project reflection.

## Project Reflection

### How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I start by visualizing the final goal and breaking it down into manageable components. I focus on modular design, ensuring each piece works independently but integrates smoothly into the whole system.

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped me improve my spatial reasoning and scene organization, particularly in translating 2D ideas into fully realized 3D environments using OpenGL.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an iterative design process: building basic shapes first, then gradually adding textures, lighting, camera controls, and physics. Each iteration added complexity while keeping the foundation stable.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The tactic of building in layers — starting simple and adding complexity through iteration — will be very useful in future software and 3D development projects.

### How do I approach developing programs?
I approach development by focusing on writing modular, clean code, emphasizing frequent testing and gradual feature additions to prevent errors from becoming overwhelming.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used incremental development and frequent visual testing after each milestone, which helped catch issues early and refine the look and feel of the 3D scene.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was crucial. I often adjusted lighting, textures, object placement, and camera behavior multiple times to ensure the scene was polished and visually accurate.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones?
Initially, I focused more on making things "work," but through the milestones, I grew to prioritize structure, readability, and reusability in my code, making future adjustments much easier.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides the technical foundation to solve complex problems creatively. The skills I've built will allow me to tackle larger development projects and specialize in fields like visualization or interactive software.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This project taught me fundamental graphics concepts like shading, transformations, and camera control, all of which will be critical for more advanced courses and projects.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
In a professional setting, being able to create realistic 3D environments or data visualizations gives me a competitive advantage, particularly for industries like gaming, simulation, architecture, or scientific visualization.
